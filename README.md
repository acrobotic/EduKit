<!--
*** The goal of these EduKits is to serve as a platform for student engagement.
*** Based on the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, these kits aim to intrigue
*** potential learners and spark a curiosity for innovation!
*** When students are free to invent and create, they begin to see technology as a
*** set of tools for solving real-world problems, and in the process, they take
*** their learning to the next level.
*** The use of programmable electronics as a hands-on learning tool makes for an
*** excellen creative medium for advancing teaching and learning. The curricula and
*** resources are designed specifically to help today’s students build skills for
*** the creative and digital economy — critical thinking, collaboration,
*** communication, curiosity, problem solving and invention.
*** Resources
*** =========
*** In here, you'll find demo code and resources for making sample projects with the Raspberry Pi. For getting started help and tutorials see the [Wiki](https://github.com/acrobotic/EduKits/wiki/).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Raspberry Pi](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Python](https://jquery.com)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://laravel.com)
