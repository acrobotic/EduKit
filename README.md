<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview

</p>

The goal of the **EduKit Modules** is to serve as a platform for student engagement. Based on the **Raspberry Pi** single-board computer, these kits aim to intrigue potential learners and spark a curiosity for innovation!

When students are free to invent and create, they begin to see technology as a set of tools for solving real-world problems, and in the process, they take their learning to the next level.

The use of programmable electronics as a hands-on learning tool makes for an excellen creative medium for advancing teaching and learning. The curricula and resources are designed specifically to help today’s students build skills for the creative and digital economy — critical thinking, collaboration, communication, curiosity, problem solving and invention.

### Built With
<p align="center">

  </a>
</p>
The different **EduKit Modules** are built using the fantastic **[Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org)**, a $35 credit card-sized Single-Board Computer able to:

* Run an **Operating System**, typically Linux
* Communicate with **Electronic Hardware** such as LEDs, motors, sensors, and many more
* Rely on community-backed, Open-Source software and hardware to facilitate building fun **DIY Projects**!

Despite specific differences, all **EduKit Modules** are developed using a common set of tools and components. The objective is to have users be able to learn the fundamentals of use once, and easily apply them to different projects—allowing them to focus on learning the subject matters rather than single-use software and hardware tools. These include:

* **[Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org/)**
* **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**
* **[DIY Electronics (sensors, interfaces and actuators)](https://acrobotic.com)**
* **[Web Technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)**
* **[Data Processing and Visualization Tools](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/data/data-services-tools)**

### List of EduKit Modules
The goal is to develop as many modules as possible, each one focused around learning a specific subject matter. So far, they include:

* **[PhysComp: Intro to Physical Computing]()**
* **[Robocar: Intro to Reinforcement Learning]()**
