The goal of these EduKits is to serve as a platform for student engagement.
Based on the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, these kits aim to intrigue
potential learners and spark a curiosity for innovation!

When students are free to invent and create, they begin to see technology as a
set of tools for solving real-world problems, and in the process, they take
their learning to the next level.

The use of programmable electronics as a hands-on learning tool makes for an
excellen creative medium for advancing teaching and learning. The curricula and
resources are designed specifically to help today’s students build skills for
the creative and digital economy — critical thinking, collaboration,
communication, curiosity, problem solving and invention.
