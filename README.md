## Overview

</p>

The goal of the **EduKit Modules** is to serve as a platform for student engagement. Based on the **Raspberry Pi** single-board computer, these kits aim to intrigue potential learners and spark a curiosity for innovation!

When students are free to invent and create, they begin to see technology as a set of tools for solving real-world problems, and in the process, they take their learning to the next level.

The use of programmable electronics as a hands-on learning tool makes for an excellent creative medium for advancing teaching and learning. The curricula and resources are designed specifically to help todayâ€™s students build skills for the creative and digital economy â€” critical thinking, collaboration, communication, curiosity, problem solving and invention.

### Built With

  </a>
</p>

The different **EduKit Modules** are built around the fantastic **[Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org)**, a $35 credit card-sized Single-Board Computer able to:

* Run an **Operating System**, typically Linux
* Communicate with **Electronic Hardware** such as LEDs, motors, sensors, and many more
* Rely on community-backed, Open-Source software and hardware to facilitate building fun **DIY Projects**!

Despite specific differences, all **EduKit Modules** are developed using a common set of tools and components. The objective is to have users be able to learn the fundamentals of use once, and easily apply them to different projectsâ€”allowing them to focus on learning the subject matters rather than single-use software and hardware tools. These include:

* **[Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org/)**
* **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**
* **[DIY Electronics (sensors, interfaces and actuators)](https://acrobotic.com)**
* **[Web Technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)**
* **[Data Processing and Visualization Tools](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/data/data-services-tools)**

### List of EduKit Modules
The goal is to develop as many modules as possible, each one focused around learning a specific subject matter. So far, they include:

* **[PhysComp: Intro to Physical Computing]()**
* **[Robocar: Intro to Machine Learning]()**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Module Structure

With ease of use, redistribution, modification, and organization in mind, each **EduKit Module** consists of a few components where all of the materials for each subject can be gathered. These are:

* A **Github repository** in an aptly named sub-directory
* A **User guide** in the Github Wiki
* A **YouTube playlist** on YouTube
* A **Google Drive directory**

##### Github repository

Here you can find the software and guides for the exercises and demos in each module. It also includes a .pdf version of the instructional presentation for each topic covered in the module. Each repository includes a `README` file with an outline of the contents, and a link to the corresponding wiki page and Google Drive directory.

##### Github wiki

Here you can find an in-depth breakdown of the steps needed to complete the activities and exercises in a module.


##### YouTube playlist

A video collection of demos and step-by-step guides for completing the activities in the module.

##### Gogle Drive directory

Here you can find the original source files of the presentation, and any other large-sized files not apt for storing on the module's Github repository.


### Pre-requisites

With the goal of the widest adoption possible of these **EduKit Modules**, there are no major pre-requisites for getting started. The module "*PhysComp: Intro to Physical Computing*" is aimed to get anyone familiar with the tools needed.

Whereas becoming an expert programmer, data analyst, electronic hardware engineer, etc., can take several years, the goal of the **EduKit Modules** is to provide a shor-term (20~30 hours) of hands-on exposure to a subject matter. This can be done for fun, vocational learning, or as part of an academic curriculum.

### Resources

Outside of the topics covered in **EduKit Modules** the tools used can be applied for a wide variety of applications. The following resources are useful for those interested in exploring beyond the confines of these modules:

* **[Donkey Car Project](https://www.donkeycar.com/)**
* **[Raspberry Pi Education](https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/)**
* **[Instructables](https://instructables.com/)**
* **[Adafruit Learning Resources](https://learn.aduafruit.com)**
* **[ACROBOTIC Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFq0T6Z3JPtnqTKEkmqCogIqQYHUmYu8)**

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

These are some examples of use cases of the EduKit modules in the wild:

For more examples, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/acrobotic/EduKits/wiki)

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

A major goal of the EduKits Project is for it to be **crowdsourced**. Improvements to existing modules as well as additions of new ones by members of the community is the way that in which the project will become the most useful for the largest number of people. If you are ready to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
